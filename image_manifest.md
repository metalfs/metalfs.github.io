# Image Manifest

The image manifest (`image.json`) contains configuration options for the FPGA image.

Example:

```json
{
    "target": "SNAP/N250S_NVMe",
    "streamBytes": 32,
    "operators": {
        "colorfilter": "./colorfilter",
        "encrypt": "@metalfs/encrypt"
    }
}

```

## Detailed Property Descriptions

**target**: 
One of the supported hardware targets for Metal FS, including the hardware shell to use (for now, only `SNAP` is supported).
The available targets are defined [here](https://github.com/osmhpi/metal_fs/tree/master/targets).

**streamBytes**:
Defines the global stream width for all operators in the image.
Note that not all operators support different stream widhts.
Recommended values: 8, 16, 32, 64

**operators**:
A JSON object, where the keys (string) define the unique operator identifier in the final image and the values (string) provide
a path to the operator sources.
If the path starts with `./`, a local operator is assumed, otherwise it is interpreted as a npm package name.
Note that npm packages are not downloaded automatically during the build process; you have to run `npm install` manually before.
