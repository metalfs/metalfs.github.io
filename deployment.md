# Deployment Guide

Once the `make image` process has finished, you will find the FPGA bitstream in `build/<target>/snap/hardware/build/Images/<bitstream>.bin`. Copy this file to your POWER machine.

Deploy it to your FPGA using the flash script from [`capi-utils`](https://github.com/ibm-capi/capi-utils), e.g.: `capi-flash-script <bitstream>.bin`.

Afterwards, perform the initial action discovery using [SNAP](https://github.com/open-power/snap) tooling:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-power/snap && cd snap
make software
# As root:
./software/tools/snap_maint -v
# If you're using NVMe storage on the FPGA card
./software/tools/snap_nvme_init
```

Now you can run either your own software that uses Metal FS as a library or start the Metal FS file system driver.
To perform the latter in a container, use
```
docker run -d \
    --name metalfs \
    --device /dev/cxl/afu0.0s \
    --device /dev/fuse \
    --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
    --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
    metalfs/metalfs:latest \
        metal-driver -s -f /mnt --metadata ./metadata
```
Note that the file system metadata is not persisted outside of the container in this configuration.

Now, you could start a shell in the container to access the file system in `/mnt`:

```
docker exec -it metalfs bash
```
